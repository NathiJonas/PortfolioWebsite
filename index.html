        <h3>CCT Newsletter</h3>
        <p> A collection of two newsletters I have created for the CCT Residence where I was a residence leadership mentor for two years. The newsletters are a showcase of all the events we have hosted during the year 2022 as the residence leadership. The writers of the articles were student journalists who were given an opportunity to hone their craft and gain experience in report writing.</p>
