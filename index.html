        <h3>CCT Newsletter</h3>
        <p> A collection of two newsletters I have created for the CCT Residence where I was a residence leadership mentor for two years. The newsletters are a showcase of all the events we have hosted during the year 2022 as the residence leadership. The writers of the articles were student journalists who were given an opportunity to hone their craft and gain experience in report writing. The newsletter helped the residence win the Residence of the Year award that year.I founded the newsletter, edited the articles, designed the templates for the pages and consolidated the newsletter.</p>

        <h3>National Healthcare Database</h3>
        <p>I created a SQL database project that is designed to empower the South African Department of Health in modernizing their approach to patient and healthcare data. The centralized National Healthcare Database and Dashboard system offers a streamlined way to manage patient information, healthcare resources and pharmaceutical distribution across provinces.</p>

        <p>The Exploratory Data Analysis done on the database is to extract important patient information that will help with giving insights on medication quantity, illness tracking, visitation and consultation scheduling and patient progress.
